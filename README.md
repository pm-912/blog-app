## Description
  This is a very basic blog-style application that encourages users
  to post and comment about various books.
  
## Usage
  The application combines front end and back end to deliver a seamless 
  experience for the user. The user must be logged in to utilize the site, 
  but once they are logged in they can make posts, and comment on other's
  posts. The front end javascript communicates with the back end databases
  to save posts and comments, and renders them onto the page.
  
## Installation
  The application uses Node.JS, Dotenv, Express, MYSQL2, Sequelize,
  bcrypt, handlebars, and express-session

## Testing
  Easy to test, try it yourself. You'll need to create a .env file
  that contains DB_NAME, DB_USER, and DB_PASSWORD values if you are
  hosting it on your local system.
